## Building PVplayer
For developers, simply run the python file `main.py` in `src/engine` to get started.

## Making Contributions
### Reporting bugs and issues
If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub. Please also include relevant information like your system environment, 
and a detailed description of the problem.

### Submitting Pull Requests
We welcome pull requests that gain Elo, or add useful functionality to the engine.
* Please test functional changes locally as of now, and share the results. We do not have a centralised testing framework, but may add it in the future.
